//Morning Assignment : Create a function that takes in two arguments,
//One that points to an array of integers and
//one for the size of the array.This function will
//return the value in the array that appears
//the most times.

#include <iostream>

//do i need pointer just pointing at size?

// int array
int myArray[5] = { 1, 5, 6, 5, 3 };
// making pointer and pointing to myArray
int* myPointer = myArray;
//int for the loop
int a;

// making function
int myFunc(int* myPointer, int size)
{

	//NOT NEEDED already known what the size is because it is already defined

//// making loop that will find size of array that is type void
//	for (size = 0; size < a ; size++);
//	{
//		
//	}


}

int main()
{

}

//what i have:
//1. an array and a pointer that points to the array
//2. a function that takes the pointer to the array and the size of array in its arguments

//what i do not have:
//1. my loop finding the size of the array is not finished
//2. not finding the one that is repeated in the array
//3. returning nothing
