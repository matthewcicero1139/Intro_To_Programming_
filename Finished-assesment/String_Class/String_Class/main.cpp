1 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM
-Name: Create a String Class
-Problem Statement: Ablility to query the strings length returning an integer

2 INPUT INFORMATION

3 OUTPUT INFORMATION
-SUPPOSED OUTPUT:It is supposed to take a character array, determine its length by itterating through it until
it raches a null character and the return its length as a integer value.
-ACTUAL OUTPUT: Nothing because I could not get it to work even dispite Dylans multiple attempts of showing me
how to do so, I could not understand how to make it iterate through, though being showed something after the
homework about asking questions and then going back to Dylan I think I understand more of what I was doing wrong

4 SYSTEM ARCHETECTURE
-HEADER FILE: Contains the class and function definitions.
-MAIN: Contains the array that was to be itterated through to find its length
-SOURCE: Contains a function definition
